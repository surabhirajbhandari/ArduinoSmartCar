# Arduino Smart Electric Vehicle 

This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for a smart electric vehicle prototype built and evolved across multiple academic projects at Drexel University. The system models a miniaturized intelligent car with adaptive driving logic, real-time environmental sensing, secure access, and live telemetry visualization - designed to simulate core elements of modern autonomous vehicles.

## Project Evolution

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: ENGR 113 â€“ Freshman Design ("The Backseat Driver")
- Constructed a remote-controlled (RC) car with a 4-wheel base and a mounted Arduino microcontroller for embedded control.
- Designed a gesture-based glove controller worn by the user, featuring an MPU6050 sensor (accelerometer + gyroscope) and an Arduino Nano/Uno to capture real-time hand motion and orientation.
- Integrated a servo motor to enable precise left and right steering functionality.
- Users could tilt their hand to move the car forward, left, or right.
- Implemented wireless communication using NRF24L01 modules to transmit sensor data from the hand controller to the car.
- Focused on **rapid prototyping**, 3D modeling, SolidWorks, basic Arduino motor control, and accelerometer integration.
- Achieved responsive gesture control with an average delay of just **~0.2 seconds**.

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: ECE 303 â€“ Embedded Systems Test-Bed (Individual Build)
- Rebuilt the system with added **collision avoidance**, **adaptive speed control**, **live dashboard**, and **sensor integration**.
- Introduced **RFID authentication**, **IR remote control**, and **buzzer alerts**.
- Developed a custom **MATLAB GUI** to display live data (distance, motor speed, temperature, coolant level, headlight status).
- Implemented **PWM-based motor logic** to adjust speed based on sensor data using `analogWrite()`.
- Used **LCD** and **serial communication** for redundant, on-device visualization.

## Features

-  **RFID Authentication**  
  Prevents unauthorized users from starting the vehicle. Each cardâ€™s UID is verified before activation.

-  **Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection & Speed Control**  
  Dynamically adjusts motor speed or halts the car completely based on object distance.

-  **Environmental Monitoring**  
  Real-time tracking of temperature (via DHT11).

- **IR Remote Input**  
  Used to control headlight intensity and simulate user interaction.

- **LCD Display**  
  Displays sensor readings and vehicle status â€” temperature, motor speed, coolant levels.

- **Live MATLAB Dashboard**  
  Reads serial data from the Arduino and displays it as a digital dashboard with warning indicators.

-  **Modular, Real-Time Logic**  
  Implements sensor fusion and decision-making for autonomous behavior using C++ classes and timers.

##  System Behavior Logic

| Distance to Obstacle | Motor Speed     | LED Feedback        |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| > 50 cm              | Full speed       | All OFF              |
| 35â€“50 cm             | Medium speed     | 1 LED ON             |
| 15â€“35 cm             | Low speed        | 2 LEDs ON            |
| < 15 cm              | Stop             | 3 LEDs or buzzer     |

Additionally:
- Headlights can be set to **off, dim, or bright** via remote.
- Warnings are displayed in **MATLAB GUI** if coolant is low or temperature exceeds safe thresholds.
